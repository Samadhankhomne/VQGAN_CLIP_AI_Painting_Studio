# Advanced Generative AI with CLIP and VQGAN

This repository demonstrates the use of advanced generative AI techniques to create and optimize images using CLIP and VQGAN architectures. It showcases a text-to-image generation pipeline in a Colab notebook, leveraging PyTorch and a variety of image processing and optimization methods. The project explores augmentation techniques, text and image encoding with CLIP, and fine-tuning image generation parameters to achieve high-quality visual results.

## Code Description

The code integrates state-of-the-art AI tools for generating and optimizing images based on textual prompts. Key features include:

### Setup and Dependencies
- Mounts Google Drive and installs required libraries like CLIP, taming-transformers, and other PyTorch-based tools.
- Provides details on GPU usage and CUDA compatibility.

### Architectures Used
- **CLIP**: Used for encoding text and image representations for similarity computation.
- **VQGAN**: Responsible for generating high-quality images with tunable latent parameters.

### Key Functions

#### Image Normalization and Visualization
- **`norm_data`**: Handles preprocessing of images.
- **`show_from_tensor`**: Displays generated images from tensors.

#### Prompt Encoding
- **`encodeText`**: Encodes text into vector embeddings, allowing the model to guide image generation.

#### Optimization Pipeline
- Implements an iterative optimization loop (**`training_loop`**) to refine images based on textual prompts, using cosine similarity loss between text and image encodings.

#### Image Augmentation
- Applies transformations like random flips and affine transformations to create diverse input crops.

### Output
- Generates images aligned with textual prompts (e.g., *"A BLUE TREE IN THE FOREST"*), excluding unwanted elements (e.g., *"watermark"*), while handling noise and augmentation.

### Training and Parameters
- Includes customizable hyperparameters for learning rate, weight decay, and noise factor.
- The training loop visualizes intermediate results, showing the progression of generated images.
